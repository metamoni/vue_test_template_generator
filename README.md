# Vue test file generator

If you use Vue Test Utils and Jest to test your components, this little app will help you generate a basic template for a spec file.<br/><br/>
Simply enter your component's name (the default import path is set to ```@/components/ComponentName.vue```), any examples you'd like to add, or a description for any contexts/methods you'd like to test. This will generate a basic template that you can copy and paste into your code editor.
